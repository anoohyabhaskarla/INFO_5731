However, I found out the ways to achieve it though it is late. By debugging and installing necessary libraries. I enjoyed the practical nature of the assignment.  It was satisfying to see the scraper successfully collect data from the website and then use NLP techniques to analyze that data. Seeing the results of the NLP analysis (POS tags, entity counts) was interesting.  It provided some insights into the text data and the kind of information that can be extracted using these techniques. but the provided time was sufficient to complete the core requirements of the assignment however, I just realized I should have been start Little more."
